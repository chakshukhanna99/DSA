reverse word wise    doubt     https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-words-in-a-given-string/


in c++ strings are character arrays
char b[10]
10 bytes sting 
no loop acts differently
cin>>b;
chakshu in last null char acii =0
works as terminator
cout<<b;
name prints until null  '\0'
char input[4]
0123
abc\0
abc
ab
ab

space tab newline problem cin chakshu khanna  ->  chakshu
cin.getline(strname,length,); 3rd para by default next line we can change
only till len printed
